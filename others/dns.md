ISP——Internet Service Provider

In most cases, ISP-provided DNS is slow, and occasionally goes down completely. Some even redirect unresolved URLs to a branded search page.

For these reasons, it’s better to instead use OpenDNS or Google’s DNS service instead of what your ISP offers.They’re more reliable, and in the case of OpenDNS, even offer extra features like content filtering, typo correction, anti-phishing, and child protection controls.

## Google's DNS

* 8.8.8.8
* 8.8.4.4

## OpenDNS

* 208.67.222.222
* 208.67.220.220
